//3) Describe the use cases for multidimensional arrays and compare them to one-dimensional arrays




// Multidimensional Arrays:

//  1.   Matrix and Tabular Data:     to represent matrix-like structures, such as grids, tables, and spreadsheets.
//                                    For example, a 2D array can represent a chessboard, a tic-tac-toe board.

//  2.   Spatial Data:                such as 3D models .

//  3.   Scientific Computing:       used to store and manipulate data like time-series data, seismic data.

//  4.   Image Processing:           images are represented as 2D or 3D arrays of pixel values. You can apply various
//                                    filters transformations, and operations to these arrays.

//  5.  Matrices in Linear Algebra:      Matrix operations like addition, multiplication, and inversion are 
//                                       performed using these arrays.





// One-Dimensional Arrays:

// 1. Sequential Data:      suitable for storing sequences of data, such as lists, 
//                          queues, stacks, and dynamic arrays.

// 2. Simple Collections:   for implementing collections like lists, sets, and bags when no specific ordering 
//                          or structure is needed.

// 3. Efficient Storage:    1D arrays are more memory-efficient and straightforward to work with compared 
//                          to multidimensional arrays.

// 4. Linear Search:        If you primarily perform linear searches or iteration through a list of items,
//                           a one-dimensional array is a straightforward choice.
